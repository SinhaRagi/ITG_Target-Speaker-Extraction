>> Directory structure:

1. Mixture contains the mixture speech created from Librispeech test-dataset, which is the sum of randomly chosen utterances of two different speakers.
2. References contains the reference speech of the target speaker having a completely different utterance than one used to create the mixture speech.
3. Groundtruth_targets contains the actual target speech to be estimated from the mixture.
4. Estimated_targets contains the estimated target speech from the mixture.

>> File naming:

1. Suffix _number indicates the corresponding example files for each directory.
For example: If Mixture file: mix_1.wav, then its corresponding files are as follows:
    Groundtruth_target: spk_1.wav, Estimated_target: est_1.wav and Reference file: ref_1.wav
